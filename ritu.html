        <h3>
          A piece of my heart<br>
A pillar of my school memories<br>
A portion of my life<br>
Through thick and thin, through highs and lows<br>
You have always been<br>
And always will be<br>
A slice of me<br>
I love you for that certain smile<br>
I love you for that tight hug<br>
I love you for your tenderness<br>
I love you for that one that somehow always says 'i love you very much'<br>
I love you for all these things<br>
And for a million others too<br>
And finally today is the day , so just seize your moments<br>
I know it's been a long time since we met but you are always safe in my heart
