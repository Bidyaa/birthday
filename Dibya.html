    <h2>Dear Doramii,<br>

I don't know exactly where to start from. School,Friends and Memories. <br>
Well, I'm not going to write any long-senti post.You've known me for all these years and you understand most of it.<br>
The best part is we're still sticked together,and will always be.<br>
I wish you all the success n happiness in life.Hope you always stay this crazy-bitch!<br><br>

You folks mean a lot to me.Without you, life would have sucked.<br>
No matter what comes in our way,I am always just one call away.<br>
And I wish if I could write all these in Korean or something like your BTS stuffs!<br><br>

Love,<br>
